### Is rwalk stable? 

rwalk is stable but it's still in the early stages of development. It should work for most use cases but there may be bugs.

### Where can I test this tool? 

You can use the [ffuf.me](http://ffuf.me) website to test rwalk.
I also wrote a [blog post](https://blog.cstef.dev/posts/web-scanning-efficiently) about it with a few cool examples.
