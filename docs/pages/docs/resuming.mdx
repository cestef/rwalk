# Saving and Resuming Scans

By default, if you abort the scan with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, rwalk will save the progress to a file called `.rwalk.json`. You can resume the scan by running with `--resume`:

```bash
rwalk --resume
```

If you want to save the progress to a different file, you can use the `--save-file` flag:

```bash
rwalk https://example.com wordlist.txt --save-file myscan.json
```

The auto-saving behavior can be disabled with `--no-save`.

<Callout type="warning">
A checksum is computed for the wordlists and stored in case you abort the scan. If you resume the scan, `rwalk` will only load the wordlists if the checksums match.
