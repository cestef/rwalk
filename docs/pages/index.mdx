A blazingly fast web directory scanner written in Rust. It's like [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) but on steroids.
It is designed to be fast in **recursive scans** and to be able to handle large wordlists.

Unlike other tools, rwalk does **<u>not</u>** provide advanced fuzzing features such as **parameter fuzzing**, **header discovery**, etc. It only does one thing and does it well.
